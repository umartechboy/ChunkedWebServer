# ESPWebServer

This git is based on the standard WebServer available in the esp core at https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/tree/master/libraries/WebServer/src. On top of it, it adds easy to use functions to support chunked responses. This is usefull for sending data with dynamic and possible large sizes, for example, dumping large logs, data tables and files.
